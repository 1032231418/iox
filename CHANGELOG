v0.3:
    1. Replace AES-CTR with Xchacha20. Because in Golang,
       only AES-GCM has assembly-speed-up, but AES-GCM in
       Golang implementation is not a stream operator, and
       need more alloc overhead.
       From the results of my test:
           amd64: Xchacha20 is 4X faster than AES-CTR
           i386: Xchacha20 is 3X faster than AES-CTR (8X slower than amd64)
    2. Increse the TCP_BUFFER_SIZE to 0x8000
    3. Fix a bug in UDP forward

v0.2.1:
    1. Add heartbeat for remote-proxy's ctl-connection, to prevent
       the NAT device drops mapping rules
    2. Reduce `Remote2Remote` function's retry frequency

v0.2:
    1. Add UDP forward mode, CLI option: `-u`

v0.1.1: 
    1. Logic optimization, while both two connections are encrypted,
       traffic will be forwarded without additional encryption and decryption
    2. Made some little improvements
